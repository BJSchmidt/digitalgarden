# Welcome to My Digital Garden!

What is a digital garden? Well it's like a blog, but not linearly constrained on a timeline. It's an interconnected web of ideas, notes, and articles. The things posted here are constantly in flux, and may be fully fleshed out articles, drafts, or even incomplete thoughts. I hope other people find some of this stuff useful or interesting.
